# BirdsCanada_GitHubGuide

This guide is currently under development (April 2022) 

The primary intentions of this guide is to walk Birds Canada staff and contractors through the process of setting up a GitHub account, basic instruction on how to use RStudio and/or GitHub Desktop to interact with GitHub, and how to share and archive your R scripts with Birds Canada.
